Right now, there is no good system to spot fake computer-generated voices. But there are tools that can take just 3 to 5 seconds of someoneâ€™s voice and use it to create full audio that sounds like them. This is a problem because people are starting to use their voice as a way to unlock secure accounts or devices. If someone can copy your voice, they might be able to break into your private information.
